# [DST] Carrotrot  

Link: Steam Workshop(https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/itemedittext/?id=2892258109)  

Inspired by Minecraft's carrot on a stick.  
Making requires a carrot and a fishing rod, which have the same freshness as carrots, and will be returned to the fishing rod when it rots.  
The basic attribute is the same as the cane. It can speed up by 25% and has 17 damage.  
You can feed the beefalo while riding by put food on the carrot rod.  
This is my first item mod. The code is rough, and other functions may be implemented in the future.  

TODO：  
1. Let beefalo run faster by consuming freshness.  
2. When holding a carrot rod, it can attract pigs, rabbits, etc. around.
